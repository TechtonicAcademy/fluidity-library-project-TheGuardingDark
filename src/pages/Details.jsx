          <q>
            Commander Sam Vimes of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch is on holiday in
            the pleasant and innocent countryside, but a body in the wardrobe
            would be far too simple. Instead he finds many, many bodies â€“ and an
            ancient crime more terrible than murder. He is out of his
            jurisdiction, out of his depth, out of bacon sandwiches and out of
            his mind, but never out of guile. Where there is a crime there must
            be a punishment.
