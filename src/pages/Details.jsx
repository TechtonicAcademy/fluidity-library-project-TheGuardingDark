        <q>
          Commander Sam Vimes of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch is on holiday in
          the pleasant and innocent countryside, but a body in the wardrobe
          would be far too simple. Instead he finds many, many bodies â€“ and an
          ancient crime more terrible than murder. He is out of his
          jurisdiction, out of his depth, out of bacon sandwiches and out of his
          mind, but never out of guile. Where there is a crime there must be a
          punishment.
